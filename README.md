# sorryINoe-TeachMeSkills_C27_Lesson_8_HW

We created a program to simulate the work of a clinic.
Three classes were described: surgeon, therapist and dentist.
Each class has a "treatmentResult" method
We also created a “Patient” class with a “Treatment Plan” field and a “Doctor” field.
Create an object of the “Patient” class and add a treatment plan to the patient.
